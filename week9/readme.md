# Stitching it all together

Week running from May 20 to May 27.

## Required
*Mandatory resources.*

This week we are trying something even more different: each student will select and read 1 paper from [ICSE 2016 (main track)](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icse/icse2016.html).
Each student must select a different paper. Once you select a paper to read you have to [announce it on this issue](https://github.com/es-upe/info/issues/19).

You can use [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) in order to find the pdf file of the paper you selected.
Please note that not every paper from that list is currently available as pdf, so check that before selecting it.

You are also free to choose between making a mini-presentation based on the paper, or answering a mini-exam on the paper. The rule for each option is presented below.

## Mini-presentation
If you choose to make a mini-presentation you have to:

* When you announce the paper, also declare your choice: mini-presentation
* Prepare slides
* Send your slides to João before Thursday midnight (May 26)
* Present it on our class (May 27)
* Time limit for the presentation: 5 min. (é bom ensaiar a apresentação para evitar problemas com o tempo)

## Mini-exam
If you choose to make a mini-exam you have to:

* Announce the paper you selected before Tuesday midnight (May 24), so that I'll be able to prepare the mini-exam.
* When you announce the paper, also declare your choice: mini-exam
